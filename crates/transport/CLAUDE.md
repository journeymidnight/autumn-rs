# Transport buffer ownership

TCP and UCX share a thread-local size-class pool. Runtime TCP must recycle ordinary
unregistered slabs even when the binary enables the `ucx` feature. Only UCX-runtime
registration fallbacks skip recycling, so registration can be retried later.
Eviction decrements registration counters only for registered slabs. Cross-thread
returns retain the existing home-thread ownership rule.

The integration test `tcp_recycles_buffers_including_in_a_ucx_capable_binary`
explicitly selects TCP and verifies pool hits, buffer reuse, and zero registered
bytes; run it both with and without `--features ucx`.

Current UCX I/O uses UCP Stream. A registered stable slab benefits send registration
reuse and application buffer ownership; it does not imply receiver-side end-to-end
zero-copy. Upstream UCX 1.16/1.18 Stream receive unpacks AM data into the destination.

## Compio 0.19 migration

The workspace uses compio 0.19.2 (Rust 1.95 or newer). Owned TCP split halves
are now two TcpStream handles sharing the socket; the public ReadHalf/WriteHalf
enums still constrain each task to its direction. Ordinary vectored forwarding
is unchanged. write_vectored_all_zerocopy is explicit: it waits for the buffer
release future even on send failure, advances only the acknowledged suffix on
partial sends, and falls back for unsupported operations or zerocopy resource
exhaustion. Cancellation leaves ownership with compio through the final CQE.
UCX uses its existing ordinary send. Callers must cap iovec counts.

zerocopy_tcp covers actual owned-buffer cancellation/close and segmented sends.
zerocopy module tests hold the completion notification pending and exercise
partial-send fallback without duplicated bytes. compio_features is an isolated
receive/scheduler benchmark; it does not set production runtime defaults.

The registered UCX cancellation test explicitly calls init_with(Ucx); merely
constructing UcxTransport does not enable regpool registration.
