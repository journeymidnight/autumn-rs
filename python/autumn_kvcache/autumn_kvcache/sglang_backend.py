# import below merely falls through to `object`, which is silent: the class
# still constructs, and the first v2 call fails with AttributeError on
# `register_mem_host_pool_v2` — inside an engine that treats a failed tier as
# "no tier". The result is a KV cache that is configured, reports no error, and
