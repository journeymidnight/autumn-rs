"""Model-identity fingerprint for tenant isolation (BUG-KVC-TENANT).

Why this exists — the live incident: deployments that pin the
served path to a constant local dir (config/tokenizer in e.g. `/model-cfg`,
weights streamed from autumn), so vLLM's `model_config.model` is the SAME
string for every model served that way. `build_tenant_suffix` inherited
sglang's assumption that `model_name` identifies a model → Qwen2.5-7B-AWQ and
Qwen2.5-32B-AWQ (same tokenizer ⇒ same token ids ⇒ same content hash) landed
in ONE tenant `model-cfg_0_1` and cross-read each other's KV. 28-vs-64-layer
mismatch made it visible; two same-shape models would have been a fully
SILENT correctness bug.

Fix: derive a deterministic fingerprint from what actually identifies the
KV bytes — architecture shape (layers / hidden / kv-heads / head-size /
vocab / dtype / quant / MLA) plus the weights source (`load_format` and, for
the autumn loader, the autumn weights `path`) plus an optional operator
`model_id`, plus the KV-CACHE dtype (`cache_config.cache_dtype`, which is
independent of the model dtype and decides the element type of the very
bytes we store), plus the LAYOUT versions (the running vLLM version and the
connector's own `VLLM_KV_STORAGE_FORMAT`): the page byte layout is an
internal detail of the vLLM build + this connector, so the same model on a
different vLLM must not read the old bytes — and fold it into the tenant
suffix. Everything here is pure at import time (no vllm/torch/autumn module
imports; the vLLM version is a lazy, guarded lookup) so it is unit-testable
offline and, more importantly, deterministic across processes: the same
deployment MUST map to the same tenant or the cache never hits.

Residual collisions this does NOT close (documented, not hidden):
- same architecture + same weights identity source — e.g. two finetunes
  loaded from the SAME local dir path on different machines with the default
  loader (no `weights_path`), or weights overwritten IN PLACE at the same
  autumn path. Use `model_id` in `kv_connector_extra_config` /
  `extra_config` to disambiguate, or store new weights at a new path.
