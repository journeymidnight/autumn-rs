"""autumn-kvcache vLLM `KVConnectorV1` adapter (Phase 3a — CPU-offload path).

Native vLLM KV connector that offloads paged KV-cache blocks into the autumn
partition layer, reusing the SAME data plane as the sglang backend
(`autumn.BatchClient` + the sync/async `_bridge`). No daemon, no local DRAM
cache — partition is the only persistence path (docs/autumn_kvcache_plan.md §13).

Plug in via:
  vllm serve <model> \\
    --kv-transfer-config '{
      "kv_connector":"AutumnKVConnector",
      "kv_connector_module_path":"autumn_kvcache.vllm_connector",
      "kv_role":"kv_both",
      "kv_connector_extra_config":{"endpoint":"manager:9001"}
    }'

Design (route A, mirrors vLLM's reference `SharedStorageConnector`):
  - scheduler role: prefix-hash lookup → autumn existence → matched-token count,
    then build per-request load/save metadata.
  - worker role: per-layer extract/inject of the paged KV tensor through autumn
    keyed by `kvc/{tenant}/vllm/{prefix_hash}/{layer_name}`.

Phase 3a target = CPU-offload KV (no GPU staging buffers), synchronous load in
`start_load_kv` (overlap is Phase 3b). The autumn-facing byte I/O is factored
into `_AutumnKVStore`, which is unit-testable WITHOUT vLLM installed.

# When a TTL is configured, the layer pages are written with a longer TTL than

# admits a load on the marker (`is_present`); if the marker outlived its layers
# the worker would load some layers and silently `continue` past the expired
# ones, leaving uninitialised KV in the paged cache (a correctness bug). With
# `layer_ttl = marker_ttl + grace` the invariant "marker present ⇒ all layers
# present" holds across both the save ordering (marker written last) and the
# scheduler-probe → worker-load gap. The grace just delays reclamation of
# already-cold pages; content-addressing makes the lingering harmless.
#
# Belt-and-suspenders: the marker is also gated on the layers ACTUALLY saving
# (see _save_failed / wait_for_save) — so a save failure for ANY reason (the
# u64 clamp below, a transport error, value-too-large) never publishes a marker
# without its layers. The grace is the timing guarantee; the gate is the
# write-success guarantee.

# The native `ttl_secs` arg is a Rust `u64`; a Python int above this fails the

# TTL is honoured rather than erroring — and, critically, so `marker_ttl + grace`
# can never exceed u64 and make the LAYER write fail while the marker (smaller
# TTL) still succeeds. Mirrors the Rust helper's `saturating_add`.
