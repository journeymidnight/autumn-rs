"""Sync ↔ async bridge for the autumn PyO3 client.

The `autumn` PyO3 module exposes async methods (each returns an awaitable that
resolves when the compio worker thread completes the RPC). sglang's
HiCacheController calls L3 backend methods **synchronously** from its
prefetch/backup daemon threads (docs/hicache_l3_interface.md:216-220), so we
own a dedicated asyncio event loop thread and dispatch coroutines onto it via
`run_coroutine_threadsafe`.

One loop per process is sufficient — sglang's worker threads share it. The
loop is created lazily on first call and lives for the process lifetime.
